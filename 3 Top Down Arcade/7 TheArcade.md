# Top Down Arcade

Let's first go over everything we've learned so far :

* [How to create, edit, and utilise Prefabs](./1%20Prefabs.md).
* [Capturing player input](./2%20PlayerInput.md).
* [Moving objects with code](./2%20PlayerInput.md/#moving-the-player).
* [Creating game objects with code](./2%20PlayerInput.md/#spawning-a-bullet).
* [Using collisions to trigger code](./3%20Health.md).
* [A basic following A.I.](./3%20Health.md/#basic-enemy-ai).
* [Making and manipulating scenes](./4%20Scenes.md).
* [Building a Heads Up Display](./5%20HUD.md).
* [Creating particle effects](./6%20/ParticleEffects.md).

Look at how much we've learned. Let's get this applied in your first real game!\
As always please feel free to look back at everything you've done to get a refresher.

## The Arcade

Now we get to make the game. But what do we mean by "Top Down Arcade Game"?\
We want to build a game that doesn't have gravity and is seen from a top down perspective. Think Pac Man, the original Zelda, and others.

There is no central template for this game. There are useful scripts in the [Library](./Library/) folder that you may use. This is just about every main script we built during the lessons. You can use and extend them to fit your game.\
Most importantly, be creative! You don't need shooting if you don't want it, or any other mechanic. Consider making a puzzle game or an adventure. Don't be tied to only doing what has been covered here.

Here are the requirements :

* A player that you can control.
* A core theme and unified asthetic including sprites and backgrounds.
* A main and interesting gameplay loop / mechanic.
* At least two different particle effects.
* At least three different scenes to play, as well as a start and end screen.
* Some form of a heads up display.
* A scoring or points system to track progress.

If you happen to create a really useful or cool bit of code that you think others going through this course you can have it added here!\
Simply [create an issue](https://github.com/DerekCresswell/GameDesign11/issues/new) containing the script and what it does. From there one of the maintainers of this course will see about adding it in.\
This can also be a great learning opportunity as being able to talk through what you've done can bring a much deeper level of understanding.
