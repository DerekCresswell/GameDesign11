# Top Down Arcade

Let's first go over everything we've learned so far :

* [How to create, edit, and utilise Prefabs](./1%20Prefabs.md).
* [Capturing player input](./2%20PlayerInput.md).
* [Moving objects with code](./2%20PlayerInput.md/#moving-the-player).
* [Creating game objects with code](./2%20PlayerInput.md/#spawning-a-bullet).
* [Using collisions to trigger code](./3%20Health.md).
* [A basic following A.I.](./3%20Health.md/#basic-enemy-ai).
* [Making and manipulating scenes](./4%20Scenes.md).
* [Building a Heads Up Display](./5%20HUD.md).
* [Creating particle effects](./6%20/ParticleEffects.md).

Look at how much we've learned. Let's get this applied in your first real game!

## The Arcade

Now we get to make the game. But what do we mean by "Top Down Arcade Game"?\
We want to build a game that doesn't have gravity and is seen from a top down perspective. Think Pac Man, the original Zelda, and others.

There is no central template for this game. There are useful scripts in the [Library](./Library/) folder that you may use.\
Most importantly, be creative! You don't need shooting if you don't want it, or any other mechanic. Consider making a puzzle game or an adventure. Don't be tied to only what we've done.

Here are the requirements :

* A player that you can control.
* A core theme and unified asthetic including sprites and backgrounds.
* A main and interesting gameplay loop / mechanic.
* Two different particle effects.
* At least three different scenes to play, as well as a start and end screen.
* Some form of a heads up display.
* A scoring or points system.
