# Grade 11 Video Game Design

## Top Down Arcade Game

This unit is where we will begin to make a more interactive game.\
Here is what is covered in this unit :

* How to create, edit, and utilize prefabs.
* How to write code that :
	* Interacts with the players inputs.
	* Switches between levels.
	* Track characters health and attacks.
	* Changes animations.
* Work with animations and particle effects.

After all the lessons, we will be making a top down arcade game. This may be anything from Space Invaders to Dungeon Crawlers. There will be a lot more creative freedom in this unit. This game will have a lot of moving parts, and we can actually play this one rather than just watch.\
Unlike with the [Dice Game](../2%20Dice%20Game) there will not be a single template file to follow. This unit will give you all the means to go through and create your own game.\
However there will be a few scripts that are for you to use that are complete but simple. You will need to expand them to make your game unique.

### Requirements

To fully complete this project you must meet the following criteria :
* Go through all the tutorials in this unit.
* Write a proposal / plan for your game idea.
* Create a top down game with levels, art, and fun gameplay.
