# Platformer

Here we will talk about using a player controller to move our player around the scene.

## Using the PlayerController

Lucky for you we will be using a premade controller for the platformer. This controller will deal with all the physics or moving and jumping. We still need to capture input and hook this up to other scripts like a health script.

//Notes

kinematic controller using raycast collisions
