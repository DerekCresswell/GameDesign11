# Platformer

What have we learned in this unit :

* [Setting up and using the PlayerController for 2D movement](./1%20PlayerController.md).
* [Creating animations using the animator](./2%20Animation.md#unitys-animation-system).
* [Utilizing the animation controller](./2%20Animation.md#animation-controllers).
* [Creating tile palettes and drawing tile maps](./3%20TileEditor.md).
* [Making a checkpoint system](./4%20Checkpoint.md).
* [Simulating the parallax effect](./5%20ParallaxEffect.md).

That is quite the array of skills. Of course, go back a re-read the lessons for any topic you may still be unfamiliar with.

## The Platform

Onto our second to last game in this whole curriculum, that's exciting.\
Here we want to create a platformer. Examples include games like Mario or Mega Man.

Just like with [the Top Down Game](../3%20Top%20Down%20Arcade) there is no single template for the game. Of course, you can use any of the scripts from the [library folder](./Library) to help you along the way. Don't forget that many scripts from the [last unit](../3%20Top%20Down%20Arcade/Library) will work with little to no tweaking.\
Also, you still do not need to make your own art for this game. You may if you want, but only if you still have a game beneath that art. When searching for assets you may find it easier to use a full "sprite sheet" rather than finding a single sprite you like the look of and trying to find more animations of it.

Now it's time for the creative part. You can plan and create your game in any way you want to. As always, don't be stuck with just what we've gone over here, take a chance and try to build something unique.

Here are the requirements to follow :

* A character to move around the environment.
* Animations for the player and enemies.
* Clear goal and direction (Checkpoint, score, etc.).
* Three gameplay levels, a start menu, end game screen, and death / loss screen.
	* Make sure the levels look unique from one another.
* Fair and fun level design that poses a challenge.
* A head's up display with relevant information (health, score, etc.).
* And finally, a secret Easter egg for players to discover.

With that you can set off to plan and build your game!
