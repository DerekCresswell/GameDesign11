# Grade 11 Video Game Design

## Final Project

Now it is time.\
Here we bring everything we've learned together and make one grand finale to these lessons.

For this project you first need to find one or two other partners to work with. Make sure you've talked to them and know who will be working on what because there are roles you must fill.

* A Coder
	* This person is in charge of the majority of coding, as the name would imply. They should be whoever feels the most comfortable with the scripts we've written so far.
* An Artist
	* This is whoever is most artistically inclined. They will be in charge of art and animations for the just about everything in the game.
* A Level Designer
	* This is only needed if your game idea is large enough.
	* This person is in charge of creating prefabs, building levels, and stitching together the others work into the final product. This person should also ensure that the plan is being followed and everything that is needed is being made.

There are some stipulations to complete this project :

// custom art
// Real plan
// Coherent goal
