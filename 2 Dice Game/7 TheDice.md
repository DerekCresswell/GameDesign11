# Dice Game

Let's go over everything we've learned so far in this unit :

* [How scripts work in Unity](./1%20UnityScripts.md).
* [How a C# program is set up](./2%20CodeStructure.md).
* [Syntax to make your code readable](./2%20CodeStructure.md/#syntax).
* [How to use and manipulate variables](./3%20Variables.md).
* How [boolean logic](./4%20Logic.md) and [control structures](./4%20Logic.md/#control-structures) work.
* [How loops work](./5%20Loops.md).
* [Breaking down a problem to solve with code](./6%20BasicGame.md).

Feel free to brush up on whatever you may need.\
You can also check into the "Extras" folder of this unit for extra resources and challenges. You can also look up a concept online and have it explained differently if it benefits you. Everything here was explained one of a countless amount of ways and may not be best for you.

## The Dice

Now time to make your own Dice Game!

Here are the requirements of this game : 

* Your game must roll **two** separate six sided dice. (We only did one in the practice but you can figure out how to add another!).
* Your game needs to include different damage and / or heal amounts for certain values on the dice.
* At least one "special attack". I.E. Rolling spider or snake eyes.
* Your game must end with one of two players winning.
* Take place entirely in the start function of your script.
* Print out a story to the console as players are damaged.

There is a template you may use to start off your project. It does not work the way it is currently, you must fix it. All it has is the main structure of a dice game program.\
Feel free to try making the whole thing yourself, in fact that is encouraged. If you find it too hard then by all means use the template as a starting point. Making some progress is infinitely better than none.\
[Check it out](./Library/DiceGameTemplate.cs).

The most important thing is to have fun! Make up a fun narrative, a dragon and a knight, a zombie and a survivor, or anything else you can think of.\
Don't be afraid to try out an idea in code, the worst that can happen is you have to press "ctrl Z". The best way to learn code is to experiment.\
Remember to use resources like the [Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html) and [C# Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).
