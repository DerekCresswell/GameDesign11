# Rube Goldberg Machine

Let's first go over everything we've learned so far :

* [The setup and usage of Unitys Editor](./1%20UnityEditor.md).
* [Game Objects](./2%20GameObjects.md).
* [Hierarchies](./2%20GameObjects.md/#hierarchies).
* [Components](./2%20GameObjects.md/#components).
* [Rigidbodies](./3%20Physics.md/#rigidbody).
* [Colliders](./3%20Physics.md/#colliders).
* [Physics Materials](./3%20Physics.md/#physics-materials).
* [Sprites](./4%20Sprites.md).
* [Tiling and 9-Slicing](./4%20Sprites.md/#tiling).

Seems like a lot but most build off of each other so they fall into place nicely when in practice.\
If any of these seem foggy to you please refer back to their coresponding section and brush up.\
You can also find extra material on some subjects in the "Extras" file in this unit. Also feel free to look up other explantions if needed. Everything was been explained a certain way here and that might not be the best way for you.

## The Machine

Finally it is time to make our Rube GoldBerg Machine!

Here's the requirements for a sufficient machine :

* As per the definetion of a Rube GoldBerg Machine it needs to complete a clear task at the end. Think press a button, score a goal, etc.
* There needs to be a unified theme between your sprites, background, and goal. Don't just choose random sprites.
* Around 10 unique steps towards the goals.
* Use each of the following at least once
	* A really bouncy object.
	* A not really bouncy object.
	* Dynamic and Static objects.

And most importantly, be creative! You can set up your level in any way you want. Not just a series of ramps to roll a ball down.\
Go back to the [Readme file](./Readme.md) in this unit and / or Google Rube Goldberg Machines for some ideas.

Go on and try something unique and have fun!
