# Grade 11 Video Game Design

## Rube Goldberg Machine

In this section we will be covering the basics of Unity along with making a fun simulation!
Topics covered include : 
* [The Unity Launcher and Editor](./1%20UnityEditor.md).
* [Game Objects](./2%20GameObjects.md), [Hierarchies](./2%20GameObjects.md/#hierarchies), and [Components](./2%20GameObjects.md/#components).
* [Physics](./3%20Physics.md), [Colliders](./3%20Physics.md/#colliders), and [Physics Materials](./3%20Physics.md/#physics-materials).
* [Sprites](./4%20Sprites.md).

Then after going through these we will make a Rube Goldberg Machine. This is a great way to get familiar with many of the main components of Unity.\
If you aren't familiar with Rube Goldberg Machines, here you go!\
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine)
> A Rube Goldberg machine is a machine intentionally designed to perform a simple task in an indirect and overcomplicated fashion. Often, these machines consist of a series of simple devices that are linked together to produce a domino effect, in which each device triggers the next one, and the original goal is achieved only after many steps.

And here are two excellent examples :
* [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w) is one by the band OK Go.
* And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOMIBdM6N7Q) is one by the YouTuber Joseph's Machines.

### Requirements

To fully complete this project you must meet the following criteria :  
* Go through all the tutorials in this project. 
* A Rube Goldberg Machine that must complete a task (turn on a light, put a ball in a basket, score a goal etc.).
* Backgrounds and sprites must be of a unified theme (like an ice hockey rink with a puck that collides with hockey sticks and ends in a net).
* Minimum of 10 steps with different physics interactions.

## Unity Manual

Unity has documentation for everything in Unity right [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/).\
This is an extremely comprehensive look into every part of the Unity Engine. If you have any questions about what something is try looking it up in the manual first. It's an important skill to have.
